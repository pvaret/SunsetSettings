Usage
=====

Overview
--------

SunsetSettings provides facilities to:

* Describe your app's settings with a type-safe API;
* Load and save settings from and to text files;
* Specialize your app's settings hierarchically per user, per site, per folder,
  etc;
* Call functions when a setting's value changes.


Creating settings
-----------------

Basics
~~~~~~

Settings are created by subclassing the :class:`~sunset.Settings` class and
adding :class:`~sunset.Key` fields to it, in the same way you would with a
`standard Python dataclass
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html>`_.

.. note::
    Under the hood, Settings is, in fact, a dataclass, and is used in much the
    same way. Unlike normal dataclasses, adding type annotations is not
    mandatory: SunsetSettings infers the type of your settings automatically.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from sunset import Key, Settings

    >>> class MySettings(Settings):
    ...    server = Key(default="127.0.0.1")
    ...    port   = Key(default=80)
    ...    ssl    = Key(default=False)

Note that you add Key instances as class attributes. Note also that Keys need
to be instantiated with a default value. SunsetSettings infers the type of a
Key from its default value.

Type annotations are not mandatory, but can be used, and are generally a good
idea:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from sunset import Key, Settings

    >>> class MySettings(Settings):
    ...     server: Key[str] = Key(default="127.0.0.1")
    ...     port: Key[int]   = Key(default=80)
    ...     ssl: Key[bool]   = Key(default=False)

The benefit of using explicit type annotations is that they serve as a
declaration of intention for what the Keys will hold, and will cause a type
error if a given default does not match the intended type of its Key.

By default, a Key can contain a `str`, an `int`, a `float`, or a `bool`. But
Keys can also contain any type that implements the
:class:`~sunset.Serializable` protocol. See
:ref:`storing-custom-types`.

As a convenience, SunsetSettings provides the :class:`~sunset.SerializableEnum`
and :class:`~sunset.SerializableFlag` classes, which are subclasses of
respectively `enum.Enum` and `enum.Flag` that implement the
:class:`~sunset.Serializable` protocol. 

.. note::

    Key values are limited to `str`, `int`, `float` and `bool` and types that
    implement the `Serializable` protocol, because SunsetSettings needs to know
    how to safely and reliably load them from and save them to text.

Related keys can be grouped together with the :class:`~sunset.Bunch` class.


Bunches
~~~~~~~

A :class:`~sunset.Bunch` provides a way to group together related Keys. This
allows you to pass only that group of Keys to the relevant parts of your
application, so that those parts can remain decoupled. For instance, you could
have one Bunch for UI-related Keys, one for network-related Keys, etc.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from sunset import Bunch, Key, Settings

    >>> class UI(Bunch):
    ...     font_name: Key[str] = Key(default="Arial")
    ...     font_size: Key[int] = Key(default=14)

    >>> class Network(Bunch):
    ...     server: Key[str] = Key(default="127.0.0.1")
    ...     port: Key[int]   = Key(default=80)
    ...     ssl: Key[bool]   = Key(default=False)

    >>> class MySettings(Settings):
    ...     ui      = UI()
    ...     network = Network()

Here too, type annotations are optional, but can be used, and are a good idea:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> class MySettings(Settings):
    ...     ui:      UI      = UI()
    ...     network: Network = Network()

.. warning::

    Note that the Bunch fields *have* to be instantiated in the Settings class
    definition, else you will encounter strange bugs that will confuse you. If
    you encounter problems where modifying the value of a Key in a Bunch also
    changes the value of the corresponding Key in another Bunch, make sure that
    your Bunch fields are properly instantiated.
    
    Using type annotations for Bunch fields ensures that the type checker will
    catch un-instantiated Bunches.

Bunches can be nested within other Bunches:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> class Colors(Bunch):
    ...     bg_color: Key[str] = Key(default="#ffffff")
    ...     fg_color: Key[str] = Key(default="#000000")

    >>> class Font(Bunch):
    ...     font_name: Key[str] = Key(default="Arial")
    ...     font_size: Key[int] = Key(default=14)

    >>> class UI(Bunch):
    ...     colors: Colors = Colors()
    ...     font: Font     = Font()

It is possible and safe to have multiple Bunch fields instantiated from the
same Bunch class:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> class MySettings(Settings):
    ...     input_ui: UI  = UI()
    ...     output_ui: UI = UI()

These Bunch instances are independent from one another, that is to say, their
Keys will not be sharing values.

Variable numbers of Keys or Bunches of the same type can be stored using the
:class:`~sunset.List` class.


Lists
~~~~~

:class:`~sunset.List` provides a container that is type-compatible with Python
lists, and can store Keys or Bunches.

A List is created by passing it an *instantiated* Key or Bunch as its argument.
This Key or Bunch instance will serve as a template for new items in the List,
but the template itself does not get added to the List. Lists are created empty.

The type of the template Key or Bunch determines the type of the List. A List
can only hold items of the same type as its template item.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from sunset import Bunch, Key, List, Settings

    >>> class Color(Bunch):
    ...     name: Key[str]    = Key(default="black")
    ...     hexcode: Key[str] = Key(default="#000000")

    >>> class MySettings(Settings):
    ...     colors = List(Color())
    ...     shapes = List(Key(default="square"))


Here too, type annotations are not mandatory but can be used, and provide extra
safety by making your intent explicit:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> class MySettings(Settings):
    ...     colors: List[Color]    = List(Color())
    ...     shapes: List[Key[str]] = List(Key(default="square"))

.. note::

    Why use a SunsetSettings List in your Settings instead of a regular Python
    list? There are a few reasons.

    * SunsetSettings Lists are type-safe even without an explicit type
      annotation.
    * SunsetSettings Lists offer :meth:`~sunset.List.appendOne()` and
      :meth:`~sunset.List.insertOne()` convenience methods to create and add to
      the List an instance of the type held in the List.
    * SunsetSettings Lists support :ref:`inheritance`.
    * Perhaps most importantly, SunsetSettings knows how to load and save Lists.


.. _storing-custom-types:

Storing custom types in Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also store in a Key any type that implements the
:class:`~sunset.Serializable` protocol. This protocol requires the
implementation of only two methods: :meth:`~sunset.Serializable.fromStr()` and
:meth:`~sunset.Serializable.toStr()`. Note that
:meth:`~sunset.Serializable.fromStr()` is a class method. SunsetSettings uses
these methods to save your type to a file and load it again reliably and safely.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import re
    >>> from typing import Optional

    >>> from sunset import Key, Settings

    >>> class Coordinates:
    ...     def __init__(self, x: int, y: int) -> None:
    ...         self._x = x
    ...         self._y = y
    ...
    ...     def toStr(self) -> str:
    ...         return f"{self._x},{self._y}"
    ...
    ...     @classmethod
    ...     def fromStr(cls, value: str) -> Optional["Coordinates"]:
    ...         m = re.match(r"(\d+),(\d+)", value)
    ...         if m is None:
    ...             return None
    ...         x = int(m.group(1))
    ...         y = int(m.group(2))
    ...         return cls(x, y)

    >>> class MySettings(Settings):
    ...     origin: Key[Coordinates] = Key(Coordinates(0, 0))


Using settings
--------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

- Instantiate your Settings class during your application's startup.

  .. note::

        Creating multiple instances of your Settings is possible, but individual
        instances will not share values.

- Load your settings from a file with :meth:`~sunset.Settings.load()`. See
  :ref:`loading and saving`.

- Pass down the relevant Settings, Bunch or Key instances to the code locations
  that will update the Keys from user actions and the code locations that will
  make use of the Keys' values.

  .. note::

        Grouping Keys into Bunches allows you to pass only the relevant Keys to
        the parts of your program that use them. This helps prevent the
        introduction of tight coupling between the individual parts of your
        program.

- Update a Key's value with :meth:`~sunset.Key.set()`, retrieve a Key's
  current value with :meth:`~sunset.Key.get()`. Clear a Key's value with
  :meth:`~sunset.Key.clear()`. When a Key's value is cleared, its reported
  value will be the value of its parent if it has one (see :ref:`inheritance`),
  else the default value for this Key.

- Add callbacks to take action when a Key's value changes with the
  :meth:`~sunset.Key.onValueChangeCall()` method. Add callbacks to take action
  when a Settings, Bunch or Key is updated in any way with their respective
  :meth:`~sunset.Key.onUpdateCall()` methods.

- Save your settings to a file when they are updated or when your application
  shuts down. See :ref:`loading and saving`.


.. _inheritance:

Inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~

Sections
........

Your application may need to override settings per user, per folder, etc. In
SunsetSettings, this is done by creating a hierarchy of subsections of your
Settings class, using the :meth:`~sunset.Settings.newSection()` method. This
method creates a new instance of your Settings that holds the same set of
Bunch, List and Key fields, with potentially different values. Those Bunches,
Lists and Keys *inherit* from the corresponding Bunches, Lists and Keys on the
parent section.

Sections can be given a name, either at creation time or after the fact by
calling the :meth:`~sunset.Settings.setSectionName()` method. This name will be
used the generate the section heading when saving your Settings to text.

Sections without a name get skipped when saving. The toplevel section is named
`main` by default, and cannot be unnamed.

Section names get normalized to lower case and alphanumeric characters, so for
instance `The Roaring 20s!` would become `theroaring20s`. Names are also unique;
if a Settings instance already holds a section with a given name, and a new
section is created on that instance using the same name, then a numeric suffix
is appended to that name to make it unique.

The :meth:`~sunset.Settings.sectionName()` method returns the current,
normalized, unique name of this instance.

The hierarchy of sections can be arbitrarily deep.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from sunset import Key, Settings

    >>> class BackupSettings(Settings):
    ...     path: Key[str]         = Key(default="/")
    ...     destination: Key[str]  = Key(default="/")
    ...     compression: Key[bool] = Key(default=False)

    >>> settings = BackupSettings()
    >>> settings.compression.set(True)

    >>> user1section = settings.newSection("User 1")
    >>> user1section.path.set("/home/user1/")
    >>> user1section.destination.set("/var/backups/user1/")

    >>> user1videossection = user1section.newSection("Videos")
    >>> user1videossection.path.set("/home/user1/Videos/")
    >>> user1videossection.compression.set(False)

    >>> mailssection = settings.newSection("Mails")
    >>> mailssection.path.set("/var/mail/")
    >>> mailssection.destination.set("/var/backups/mails/")

Here is what these Settings would look like when saved to a file:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import io
    >>> text = io.StringIO()
    >>> settings.save(text)
    >>> print(text.getvalue(), end="")
    [main]
    compression = true
    [mails]
    destination = /var/backups/mails/
    path = /var/mail/
    [user1]
    destination = /var/backups/user1/
    path = /home/user1/
    [user1/videos]
    compression = false
    path = /home/user1/Videos/


Bunches, Lists and Keys
.......................

When you create a new section for your Settings, the Bunches, Lists and Keys in
that section are automatically set up to inherit from the corresponding Bunches,
Lists and Keys in the parent section.

.. note::

    Parents and their children do not increase each other's reference count.
    This prevents hard to debug memory leaks when deleting sections.

A Key that does not have a value set on it, but has a parent, returns its
parent's value instead of its default.

A Bunch's behavior does not change when it has a parent. Giving it a parent
only recursively sets up inheritance for the Bunches, Lists and Keys held in
that Bunch.

A List's behavior does not change when it has a parent except for the
:meth:`~sunset.List.iter()` method. This method return an iterator on the List's
items and optionally its parent's items. An optional parameter indicates if the
parent's items will be returned, and if so, whether they will be returned before
or after this List's items. The default value for this parameter for a given
List can be set on that List at creation time.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from sunset import Key, List, Settings

    >>> class BackupSettings(Settings):
    ...     path: Key[str] = Key(default="/")
    ...     ignore_patterns: List[Key[str]] = List(
    ...         Key(default="*"), order=List.PARENT_FIRST
    ...     )

    >>> settings = BackupSettings()    

    >>> user1section = settings.newSection("User 1")
    >>> user1section.path.set("/home/user1/")
    >>> user1section.ignore_patterns.appendOne().set("*.tmp")

    >>> user1codesection = user1section.newSection("Code")
    >>> user1codesection.path.set("/home/user1/Code/Python/")
    >>> user1codesection.ignore_patterns.appendOne().set("*.py")
    >>> user1codesection.ignore_patterns.appendOne().set("__pycache__")

    >>> print([
    ...     pattern.get() for pattern in user1codesection.ignore_patterns.iter()
    ... ])
    ['*.tmp', '*.py', '__pycache__']


.. _loading and saving:

Loading and saving settings
---------------------------

Load settings from an open text-mode file object with
:meth:`~sunset.Settings.load()`. Save settings to an open, writable text-mode
file object with :meth:`~sunset.Settings.save()`.

Alternatively, use the :class:`~sunset.AutoSaver` context manager to
automatically load and save your settings.

SunsetSettings uses an INI-like file format to store settings. This format is
intended to be easy to make sense of for humans.

That being said, SunsetSettings is primarily intended for settings that will be
modified from within an application, for instance with a configuration UI.
Editing the settings file manually is possible, but can be unsafe, because lines
that contain syntax errors are silently ignored on loading, and therefore will
be lost entirely on saving. This extends to comments you might manually add to
the file: those will be lost too.

.. note::

    Because the :meth:`~sunset.Settings.load()` and
    :meth:`~sunset.Settings.save()` methods take an already open text file
    object as their argument, those methods don't get a say in which encoding
    the target file will use. Be sure to open the file using an encoding capable
    of holding any character that can be used in a setting by the users of your
    application. If in doubt, use `UTF-8`.
