Welcome to SunsetSettings's documentation!
==========================================

SunsetSettings is a library that provides facilities to declare and use
layerable settings in a *type-safe* manner, and load and save them in a simple
INI-like format.

The settings can safely store arbitrary types, and can be structured in an
arbitrarily deep hierarchy of layers, which allows you to easily implement
configuration overrides per project, per folder, per user, etc.
