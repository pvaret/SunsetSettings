class Settings(Bundle, Lockable):
    """
    A collection of keys that can be saved to and loaded from text, and supports
    subsections.

    Under the hood, a Settings class is a dataclass, and can be used in the same
    manner, i.e. by defining attributes directly on the class itself.

    Settings instances support subsections: calling the :meth:`newSection()`
    method on an instance creates a subsection of that instance. This subsection
    holds the same keys, with independant values. If a key of the subsection
    does not have a value, its value will be looked up on its parent section
    instead. The hierarchy of sections can be arbitrarily deep.

    When saving a Settings instance, its subsections are saved with it under a
    distinct heading for each, provided they have a name. A section is given a
    name by passing it to the :meth:`newSection()` method, or by using the
    :meth:`setSectionName()` method on the new section after creation.

    The name of each section is used to construct the heading it is saved under.
    The top-level Settings instance is saved under the `[main]` heading by
    default.

    Anonymous (unnamed) sections do not get saved.

    Example:

    >>> from sunset import Key, Settings
    >>> class AnimalSettings(Settings):
    ...     hearts: Key[int] = Key(default=0)
    ...     legs: Key[int]   = Key(default=0)
    ...     wings: Key[int]  = Key(default=0)
    ...     fur: Key[bool]   = Key(default=False)
    >>> animals = AnimalSettings()
    >>> animals.hearts.set(1)
    >>> mammals = animals.newSection(name="mammals")
    >>> mammals.fur.set(True)
    >>> mammals.legs.set(4)
    >>> humans = mammals.newSection(name="humans")
    >>> humans.legs.set(2)
    >>> humans.fur.set(False)
    >>> birds = animals.newSection(name="birds")
    >>> birds.legs.set(2)
    >>> birds.wings.set(2)
    >>> aliens = animals.newSection()  # No name given!
    >>> aliens.hearts.set(2)
    >>> aliens.legs.set(7)
    >>> print(mammals.hearts.get())
    1
    >>> print(mammals.legs.get())
